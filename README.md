## About
> This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and assignments from a JavaScript course I'm currently taking. Each exercise or assignment is stored in a separate branch, allowing me to keep track of my progress and practice through the course material.
> 
> The course covers a wide range of JavaScript topics, including:
> 
> - Syntax and basic language features
> - Control flow and conditional statements
> - Functions and scope
> - Arrays and objects
> - DOM manipulation
> - Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
> - ES6 and modern JavaScript features
> 
> By organizing my work in this repository, I can easily refer back to previous exercises, compare my solutions, and demonstrate my growing proficiency in JavaScript. This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my JavaScript learning journey.
>
> Feel free to explore the branches and check out the different exercise solutions. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement
