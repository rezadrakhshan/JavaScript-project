        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>The number guessing game is a simple and entertaining game where the objective is for the player to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. This game can be played with a computer or among players, and it is a great exercise for practicing logic and problem-solving skills.</p>
        <h2>Rules of the Number Guessing Game</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Range Selection:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The game will set a range of numbers (e.g., 1 to 100).</li>
                <li>The computer will randomly choose a number within this range.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Number of Attempts:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Players will have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.</li>
                <li>The number of allowed attempts can vary based on the difficulty level. For example, in a range of 1 to 100, a common limit is 10 attempts.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Making a Guess:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The player makes a guess within the specified range.</li>
                <li>The computer provides feedback for each guess:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Too High: If the guess is higher than the target number.</li>
                        <li>Too Low: If the guess is lower than the target number.</li>
                        <li>Correct: If the guess matches the target number.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Winning the Game:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The player wins the game if they guess the correct number within the allowed number of attempts.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Losing the Game:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The player loses the game if they fail to guess the correct number within the allowed number of attempts.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h2>Strategies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Binary Search:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with the middle number of the range.</li>
                <li>Adjust the range based on whether the guess is too high or too low.</li>
                <li>This strategy helps to narrow down the possible numbers quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Track Previous Guesses:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep a record of previous guesses to avoid repeating them and to refine the range of possible numbers.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
